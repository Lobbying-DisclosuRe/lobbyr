Description: This package allows users to query the Senate federal lobbying disclosures database (https://lda.senate.gov/api/redoc/v1/) 
    to find out how much companies are spending to lobby the federal government. It allows for search terms such as keywords, time periods
    and company names. It then attempts to clean, or at least flag, filings that could provide incorrect results when seeking to answer
    the question. How much is being spent on lobbying our Congress and the administration?
