Description: This package allows users to query the Senate federal lobbying 
    disclosures database <https://lda.senate.gov/api/redoc/v1/> to find out how 
    much companies are spending to lobby the federal government. It allows for 
    search terms such as keywords, time periods and company names. It then 
    attempts to clean, or at least flag, filings that could provide incorrect 
    results when seeking to answer the question: How much is being spent on 
    lobbying our Congress and the administration?
