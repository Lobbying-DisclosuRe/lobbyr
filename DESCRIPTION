Description: Giving users seeking federal lobbying disclosures an easier way to query the API maintained by the 
    Senate federal lobbying disclosures database <https://lda.senate.gov/api/redoc/v1/> to find out how 
    much companies and other entities are spending to lobby Congress and the federal government. It allows for 
    search terms such as keywords, time periods and entity names. It then attempts to clean, 
    or at least flag, filings that could provide incorrect results when seeking to answer the 
    question: How much is being spent on lobbying our Congress and the administration and what 
    issues do they care about?
